Jepeto: Jekyll Post Editor
==========================

Jepeto is a gem that is used to generate Jekyll post files with the
appropriate name and YAML Front Matter.

Roadmap
-------

- Edit a post file and the YAML Front Matter simultaneously or
  individually using Jepeto.
- When run without any args, give the choice (via a config file, maybe?)
  to generate a post file with a default name and YAML Front Matter.

Compatibility
-------------

Jepeto require Ruby 1.9+ and will be tested exclusively with Ruby
1.9.2+. MiniTest will be used instead of Test::Unit and until the
official version of Chronic is compatible with Ruby 1.9, the
`aaronh-chonic` gem will be used instead.
